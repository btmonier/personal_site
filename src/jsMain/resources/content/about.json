  "bio": "I am a research associate and software developer in the [Buckler Lab](https://www.maizegenetics.net/) at Cornell University. I am also the developer and maintainer of various sotware libraries and web applications including [TASSEL](https://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel), [ViDGER](https://github.com/btmonier/vidger), [IRIS-EDA](https://github.com/btmonier/iris), [rTASSEL](https://github.com/maize-genetics/rTASSEL), and [rPHG](https://github.com/maize-genetics/rPHG2).\\n\\nMy research interests lie in bioinformatics, software development, and education. Currently based at the Buckler Lab at Cornell University, I have worked on methods to efficiently assemble and annotate several hundred wild grass relatives of maize and sorghum through the [PanAnd Project](https://www.panandropogoneae.org/). I have also worked with the [Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI)](https://ilci.cornell.edu/). My involvement at ILCI included working with centers of innovation to develop genomic analytical pipelines to be used with cloud computing and improving TASSEL to work with plant breeders across the ILCI network.\\n\\nBefore coming to Cornell, my research focused on bioinformatics approaches to microbial interactions in next-generation lignocellulosic feedstocks and their impact on biomass development.",
